Homework:
    Implement linear regression for the adult income dataset using Python. Data
    available in /u/cs246/data/adult and /u/cs446/data/adult. Take the sign of
    the output of linear regression as the predicted class label in order to
    compute the accuracy of your classifier.

    linear_regress.py: the python script that finds the best lamda among given range 
    
    README

************************       Algorithm     ***********************************

    INPUT: X_train, y_train, X_dev, y_dev, X_test, y_test, lamda[], 
    number_of_threads

    partition lamdas[] into number_of_threads of subsets lamda[l[]]

    for l in lamda[]
        w = (X_train^t * X_train + l * I)^-1 * X_train^t * y_train
        y_p = X_dev * w
        acc = accuracy(y_p, y_dev)
        if(acc > max_acc)
            max_acc = acc
            best_lamda = l
            best_w = w

    y_predict = X_test * best_w

    OUTPUT: accuracy(y_predict, y_test)

***********************      Instructions    ***********************************

    python regress.py <min_lamda> <max_lamda> <number_of_lamda>  
    <number_of_threads>

    For example, if you want to find the best lamda from 1, 2, 3, ..., 100 using
    2 threads, the command should be: 
        python regress.py 1 100 100 2

    If you want to find the best lamda from 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 100.0 using 50
    threads the command should be: 
        python regress.py 0.1 100.0 1000 50

    NOTE: too many threads may cause trouble!

***********************        Results       ***********************************

    To find the best lamda, I tested lamda values 0.1, 0.2, ... 50000.0.
    The best lamda turns out to be 81.2 and the corresponding accuracy in
    dev data prediction is 84.9%. The corresponding accuracy in test data
    prediction is 84.6%.

***********************    Interpretation    ***********************************

    Lamda is used in the linear regression model to prevent over-fitting by
    restricting the value of w.
    
    Too large a lamda value is likely to result in poor-fitting, while too small
    a lamda value is likely to result in over-fitting.

    As far as I know there is no known predicting accuracy function on lamda.
    It's not practical to set the goal as finding the best lamda since possible
    lamda values include all positive real numbers. What's worse is that
    we don't even know if prediction accuracy is a monotonous function of lamda 
    in any given continuous interval of lamda value.
    
    Thus a more reasonable goal is to find a lamda that results in an 
    acceptable predicting accuracy. As in this homework, we set the minimum
    acceptable accuracy to 60%. We are fortunate enough to find a lamda within 
    range of 0.1 to 5000.0 that produces an accuracy of 84.9% in dev data
    prediction as well as an accuracy of 84.7% in test data prediction.
